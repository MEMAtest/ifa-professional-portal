# PLANNETIC
## Strategic Financial Advisory Platform
### Investor Brief | January 2025

---

## THE PROBLEM

**UK financial advisers are trapped in an administrative nightmare.**

Every Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) in the UK must prove that every piece of advice they give is "suitable" for their client. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) demands detailed documentation, audit trails, and evidence of due diligence.

### The Reality for Advisers Today

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Fragmented Tools** | Advisers use 5-7 separate software systems that don't talk to each other |
| **Spreadsheet Hell** | Client data lives in Excel files, Word documents, and email folders |
| **Compliance Burden** | 40%+ of adviser time spent on paperwork instead of clients |
| **Audit Anxiety** | When the FCA asks for evidence, advisers scramble to find documents |
| **Expensive Stack** | Paying £420-530/month for separate tools that overlap |
| **No Single View** | No unified dashboard showing client health, compliance status, or risks |

### What Triggers These Problems?

1. **New Client Onboarding** - Gathering fact-finds, risk profiles, financial data across multiple systems
2. **Annual Reviews** - Pulling together performance data, checking suitability still applies
3. **FCA Inspections** - Proving every recommendation had proper justification
4. **Consumer Duty (July 2023)** - New regulation requiring ongoing proof of good outcomes
5. **Team Handovers** - When an adviser leaves, their client knowledge is lost in scattered files

## THE SOLUTION: PLANNETIC

**One platform. Every workflow. Complete compliance.**

Plannetic is purpose-built for how IFAs actually work. Every feature was designed by people who've lived the compliance burden firsthand.

---

## WHAT PLANNETIC DOES

### 1. SUITABILITY ASSESSMENTS (Core Feature)

**The Problem:** The FCA requires advisers to document why every recommendation is suitable for each client (COBS 9.2). Most advisers use Word templates, creating inconsistent, hard-to-audit documents.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Guided questionnaire walks advisers through every required field
- Automatic flags when answers suggest higher risk or vulnerability
- Built-in attitude-to-risk (ATR) scoring
- Generates compliant PDF reports with one click
- Full audit trail - every edit timestamped and stored
- Draft save/resume - advisers can complete over multiple sessions

**User Flow:**
```
Select Client → Start Assessment → Answer Questions →
Review Flags → Generate Report → Client Signs → Filed Automatically
```

---

### 2. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS

**The Problem:** Clients ask "Will I have enough money to retire?" Advisers either guess, use basic calculators, or pay £175+/month for Voyant/Timeline.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Runs 1,000+ probability scenarios against client's actual data
- Shows success rates: "95% chance your money lasts to age 90"
- Three scenarios: optimistic, base case, pessimistic
- Beautiful charts clients actually understand
- Integrated with client's real financial data - no re-entry
- Professional PDF reports for client meetings

**User Flow:**
```
Select Client → Set Retirement Goals → Run Simulation →
Review Scenarios → Generate Report → Share with Client
```

---

### 3. CASH FLOW MODELING

**The Problem:** Advisers need to show clients how their money flows over 20-30 years. Most use Excel or expensive add-ons.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Multi-year cash flow projections
- Factor in pensions, ISAs, property, inheritances
- Stress test against inflation, market crashes, longevity
- Visual timeline showing money in vs money out
- Scenario comparison: "What if you retire at 60 vs 65?"
- Exportable reports for client files

**User Flow:**
```
Input Income Sources → Add Expenses → Set Milestones →
Run Projections → Compare Scenarios → Export Report
```

---

### 4. COMPLIANCE HUB

**The Problem:** FCA requires firms to maintain registers of complaints, breaches, and vulnerabilities. Most use separate spreadsheets with no oversight.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**

**Complaints Register**
- Log complaints with auto-generated reference numbers
- Track resolution status and timelines
- Flag FCA-reportable complaints
- Dashboard showing complaint trends

**Breach Register**
- Document regulatory breaches with severity levels
- Track remediation actions
- Audit trail for FCA inspections

**Vulnerability Register**
- Flag vulnerable clients (elderly, health issues, financial stress)
- Ensure extra care is documented
- Consumer Duty compliance proof

**AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**
- Client AML status tracking
- Check history and documentation
- Alerts for overdue checks

**Consumer Duty Monitoring**
- Real-time compliance scoring
- Proactive alerts before issues become problems
- Evidence of "good outcomes" for regulators

---

### 5. QA & FILE REVIEWS

**The Problem:** FCA expects firms to have "four-eyes" checking - a second person reviews advice before it goes to clients. Most firms do this informally with no audit trail.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Structured review workflows with checklists
- Reviewer approval/rejection with comments
- Risk rating system (low/medium/high/critical)
- Status tracking through entire review lifecycle
- Complete audit trail proving oversight happened

**User Flow:**
```
Adviser Submits File → Reviewer Assigned → Checklist Completed →
Approved/Rejected → Comments Logged → Audit Trail Created
```

---

### 6. DOCUMENT GENERATION & E-SIGNATURES

**The Problem:** Advisers spend hours formatting reports in Word. Clients print, sign, scan, and email back.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- One-click PDF generation from any assessment
- Professional branded templates
- E-signature integration (OpenSign)
- Automatic filing to client record
- Document status tracking (sent, viewed, signed)

---

### 7. CLIENT PORTAL

**The Problem:** Clients have no visibility into their financial plan. They wait for annual review meetings to see progress.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Branded portal clients can log into
- View their assessments, reports, and documents
- See portfolio performance against goals
- Secure messaging with their adviser
- Download documents anytime

---

### 8. TASK & WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT

**The Problem:** Advisers track tasks in Outlook, sticky notes, or their head. Annual reviews get missed. Follow-ups fall through cracks.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Task assignment and tracking
- Calendar integration
- Automated reminders for reviews, birthdays, policy renewals
- Team visibility - managers see all adviser workloads
- Sign-off workflows for compliance tasks

---

### 9. REPORTING & ANALYTICS

**The Problem:** Firm owners have no real-time view of business health. They run reports quarterly in Excel.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- Live dashboard with key metrics
- AUM (Assets Under Management) tracking
- Client risk distribution charts
- Compliance metrics at a glance
- Export to CSV/PDF for board reports
- Drilldown by adviser, client segment, or time period

---

### 10. ADMIN & MULTI-FIRM MANAGEMENT

**The Problem:** Firms with multiple advisers struggle with user management, billing, and oversight.

**How Plannetic Solves It:**
- User management with role-based permissions
- Seat-based billing (add/remove users easily)
- Firm-level compliance dashboards
- Activity logging for audit purposes
- Multi-tenant architecture (complete data isolation between firms)

## WHY NOW?

1. **Consumer Duty (July 2023)** - New FCA regulation created urgent compliance burden
2. **Advisers seeking consolidation** - Tired of 5+ tool subscriptions that don't integrate
3. **Legacy competitors are stale** - Intelliflo, etc. are slow, expensive, and dated
4. **Production-ready platform** - Just needs distribution, not development
5. **Demographic shift** - Adviser workforce aging, firms need modern tools to attract talent
