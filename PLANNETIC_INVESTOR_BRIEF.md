# PLANNETIC
## Strategic Financial Advisory Platform
### Investor Brief | January 2025

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**UK financial advisers are drowning in admin while using 5+ disconnected tools to stay compliant.**

The UK has **27,000+ Independent Financial Advisers** managing **£1.4 trillion** in client assets. Each adviser spends **40%+ of their time on compliance documentation** instead of serving clients.

Plannetic replaces fragmented spreadsheets and legacy software with a single, compliance-first platform.
